## 🚀 Overview

**Misinformation Detection Engine** is an NLP-powered fake news classifier designed to identify and filter out misinformation using state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques. This project utilises natural language processing to analyse news content and assess its authenticity, enabling users and organisations to combat the spread of fake news.

## 🧑‍💻 Features

- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares raw news articles for analysis.
- **Multiple ML Models:** Implements a variety of machine learning algorithms for robust detection.
- **Visual Analytics:** Interactive visualisations for data exploration and results interpretation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Core Libraries:** scikit-learn, NLTK, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Deployment:** (Optional) Streamlit or Flask for web app interface
